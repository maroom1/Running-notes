heartbeat for every 3 sec

client HDFS uses a special plugin called viewFS  to view the logical, global namespace as a single entity 

gen 1 limitations resolved using federation installing different namenodes for different apps
block pool helps to know about every namenode in federation

ACTIVE and standby namenode willbe in sync WITH THE HELP OF ZOO KEPER
ALL DATANODES	 WILL send heartbeat to two namenodes

active writes to zookeper edit logs then to standby namenode

in gen 2 sn is optional

Hadoop folder :

hadoop-env.sh  --- java_home which is used for running hadoop core scripts  -- heapsize ,datanode heapsize etc properties can be configured
core-site.xml  -- where namenode has to run -- hdfs://localhost:9000 --fs.defaultFS --- fs.default.name
hdfs-site.xml ---- dfs.replication --1 --- dfs.permissions(if this used only main user can delete files) --false--
						dfs.namenode.name.dir --- it determines where the local namenode table stored(fsImage)
						dfs.namenode.data.dir -- datanode
mapred-site.xml ----- mapreduce.framework.name -- yarn
yarn-site.xml  --- nodemanager  --- > confifure auxillary services 
masters  ---- used for secondary namenode for gen 2 it is optional
slaves ---- datanode and nodemamangers machines like localhost or some IP address

 
--------
hadoop jar jarfilename 

MR dump can be seen in console 

distcp is used to copy from different clusters
