-- order by -> give us global sorting.
-- who does it? shuffle and sort or single reducer.
-- select x, y, z from t1 order by x asc;
-- this will use a single reducer in order to 
-- achive global sorting.

-- sort by
-- select x, y, z from t1 sort by x asc;
-- each reducer gets a sorted portion, but the sorting
-- is not global.
